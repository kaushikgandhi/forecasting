Using the API is as easy as visiting:

<pre data-language="python">
http://api.getforecasting.com/{KEY}/{LON}n/{LAT}w/{FIELD}
</pre>

In the near future, we'll even include a few fun graphics that you can throw on your site to easily incorporate current weather conditions.

In the meantime, head over and <a href="/api">sign up for an api key</a>!
